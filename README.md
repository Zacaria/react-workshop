# Lab #3: Composition

This lab is split into three parts which can be found in these branches:
- 3-1-compose
- 3-2-compose

# Part 1

Your task in this lab is to create to make your Planets component load planets from the Star Wars universe. In this case the `compose` function has already one higher order component `withFetch` to fetch the data. Unfortunately it breaks since we don't handle the loading state yet. Since we are going to re-use loading screens many times we want to create a higher order component `withLoading`.

You need fill build the `withLoading` component and then use it in the `compose` section of the `src/Planets.js` component. The goal is that a loading screen is shown until the data is successfully fetched.

With `npm start` you can run the application, but it will fail with `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of null`.

## Testing

To make it easier for you to complete this task, we've added tests verifying that you've arrived at the correct app. Initially they will fail with `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of null`. This command will run the tests:

```sh
npm test
```
